## Chamber of Legal Students website

This is the website for the Chamber of Legal Students. It is built
using the [Bell](https://bootstrapmade.com/bell-free-bootstrap-4-template/)
Bootstrap theme, which has been converted into a template for use
with the [Metalsmith](http://www.metalsmith.io/) static site
generator. Have a look in the [src/index.md](src/index.md) file,
where variables are set that are in turn used by the template. That file
is written in [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) format
but its contents should be fairly easy to understand and edit.

It is designed for hosting on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with
[Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for rebuilding the pages
when the contents of this github repository change.
