vision: >
  The Chamber of Legal students is an organisation that is fully operated and established by students for the purpose of providing
  free disciplinary defensive and advisory solutions for pupils in basic education. The organisation is of the view that disciplinary
  hearings are in most instances not conducted fairly against alleged perpetrators, particularly with the due process not taking place
  and the South African School's Act being breached by school governing bodies as a result. In light of this realisation, The Chamber of
  Legal Students is committed in aiding pupils facing disciplinary hearings with the best possible defensive solutions provided by Law Students.
  The organisation also carries an extended vision which is to provide students with a place where they can practise Law whilst
  they are students and put their legal knowledge to the test.
